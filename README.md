## Lore
In the mystical land of Cumland, a bird named Cum has been the subject of ridicule due to his phallic appearance. Despite being an outcast among his fellow feathered friends, Cum possesses a unique skill: dodging towers.
As the legend goes, in the heart of Cumland stands a tower that none have ever managed to evade. But Cum has been able to masterfully navigate through its perilous obstacles, earning the attention of none other than Tucker Carlson, a renowned judge from the esteemed Fox News.
It is said that Tucker Carlson has the power to recognize true talent and separate it from mere hype. And so, Cum has been summoned to prove his worth in front of the prestigious judge. The stakes are high, for if Cum succeeds, he will be celebrated as a hero and earn the respect of his peers. However, if he fails, he risks further alienation and mockery.
With the support of his trusted companions, Cum must overcome his own doubts and showcase his unique talent. Will he emerge victorious and prove to the world that his appearance does not define his worth? Only time will tell in this epic tale of skill, courage, and triumph.
